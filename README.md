# Predicting Electricity Consumption and Enhancing Interpretability with Machine Learning
## Overview
This GitHub repository focuses on predicting electricity consumption in buildings using machine learning models. The project aims to enhance building energy efficiency and flexibility while addressing the challenge of model interpretability through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

## Key Features
**Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost for accurate electricity consumption predictions.
**Explainability Techniques**: Incorporates XAI methods, including feature importance, to enhance model interpretability.
**Dataset**: Evaluates models on the Grenoble University building dataset, offering non-aggregated electricity consumption data for various room types over two years.

## Results
Evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and 𝑅² are employed to assess the performance of the models in 24-hour ahead predictions. The results show competitive performance among the models, with XGBoost exhibiting the highest 𝑅² score. Explainability results using feature importance techniques are presented, shedding light on the significant features influencing predictions.
